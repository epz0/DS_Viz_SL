# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Interactive scatter plot with click-to-inspect — clicking any point shows solution details, screenshot, and metrics, with performance chart syncing to selected participant.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 - Data Preparation & Pre-Computation

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 5 (Data Preparation & Pre-Computation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-14 — Completed 00-01-PLAN.md (Pre-computation pipeline)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 00 | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 5 min
- Trend: Establishing baseline

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Streamlit over Vercel: Python-native, minimal rewrite, existing plotly charts carry over
- Pre-compute pipeline: Eliminates ~400MB of heavy deps from deployment
- streamlit-plotly-events for clicks: Only viable Streamlit option for plotly click interactions
- Keep all scripts in repo: Existing analysis/stats/validation scripts still useful for local work
- Modular CLI with individual steps + 'all' command: Flexible execution and debugging (00-01)
- Skip-if-exists logic with --force override: Avoid redundant computation during development (00-01)
- Fail-fast error handling: No silent catches to ensure pipeline integrity (00-01)
- Production UMAP params (NN=115, MD=0.15, densm=2): Not dev values from interactive_tool.py (00-01)
