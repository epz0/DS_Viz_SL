<objective>
Verify the complete app deploys and runs stably on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Purpose: All features are built locally. This plan verifies the deployed environment handles 63 traces, visibility toggling, click interactions, and all metrics within the Community Cloud's 1GB memory limit.

Output: Confirmed deployment with verified memory usage.

  <name>Task 1: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud and verify stability</name>
  <files>streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py</files>
  <action>
Push latest code to GitHub and deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud. The user verifies the deployed app has all features working within memory limits.

What was built: Complete Streamlit app with all Dash app features -- scatter plot with convex hulls, exploration arrows, visibility controls, click handling, detail panel with all creativity/novelty/performance metrics, participant filtering, and performance chart.

Steps for user verification:
1. Push latest code to GitHub (if not already): `git push origin main`
2. Visit Streamlit Community Cloud dashboard at https://share.streamlit.io/
3. If app is already deployed, it should auto-update. If not, deploy pointing to `streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py`
4. Wait for the app to boot (1-2 minutes on cold start)
5. Verify these features in the deployed app:
   - Light gray background hull visible covering design space
   - Colored participant hulls visible (toggle Areas checkbox)
   - Exploration arrows visible (toggle Arrows checkbox)
   - Click a point: detail panel shows all sections including creativity metrics
   - Filter participants: hulls and arrows update correctly
   - Performance chart syncs with scatter clicks (if Phase 4 complete)
6. Check memory: Streamlit Cloud dashboard > App settings > memory indicator
7. Interact for 2-3 minutes (click, toggle, filter) to verify stability

Resume signal: Type "approved" if app runs stably, or describe any issues.
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms deployed app is functional and stable by interacting with all features for 2-3 minutes without crashes or memory warnings.</verify>
  <done>App deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, all features verified working, memory under 800MB target, user approved.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. App accessible at Streamlit Community Cloud URL
2. All visual features render (hulls, arrows, scatter points)
3. All interactive features work (click, filter, toggle)
4. No "App over its resource limits" error during normal usage
5. Memory stays under 1GB hard limit (target < 800MB)

<success_criteria>
- App deploys and boots successfully on Streamlit Community Cloud
- All features functional in deployed environment
- No memory-related crashes during normal interaction
- User confirms deployment is stable
</success_criteria>
